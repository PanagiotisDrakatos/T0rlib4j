# Basic Overview
T0rlib4j is a Java controller library for Tor. With it you can use Tor's control protocol to communicate against the Tor process, or build things such as arm. T0rlib4j latest version is 1.0.1 (released October 11rd, 2017).

In addition, this library simulates and tends to look like a classic messaging app designed for activists, journalists, and anyone else who needs a safe, easy and robust way to communicate via tor network, without being monitored or blocked by their mobile internet service provider.To sum up the main goal is to protect users and their relationships from surveillance by having the ability to transparently torify all of the TCP traffic on your Java Programm.


# Why Should i use it?
Well, to begin with, T0rlib4j  have all you need to connect  to hiddenservices in order to communicate with 2 or more entities in one library. Tor makes it possible for users to hide their locations while offering various kinds of services, such as web publishing or an instant messaging server. Using Tor "rendezvous points," other Tor users can connect to these hidden services, each without knowing the other's network identity. This <a href="https://www.torproject.org/docs/tor-hidden-service.html.en">page</a> describes the technical details of how this rendezvous protocol works.

 Start using it right now, you can save more 100 hours of software  by writing code. if you feel that you need to use java as your programming library for your projects this is the right place to start, for the follownig reasons.

 * This java library  is well designed and fully updated than every other java library for tor implementation by far
 * It is really easy to use you. The only thing to do is to include the dependency and you are ready to write some sample code to get you started [How to Start](#java).
 * The project will try to stay full updated with the latest tor patches <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en">tor-win32-0.3.1.7</a>.
 * They may make it harder for your ISP or anyone else to track your activities. For more info click <a href="https://github.com/PanagiotisDrakatos/T0rlib4j/wiki/How-Online-Anonymity-is-preserved-in-combination-with-Tor"> here</a>.
 * It is free and open source and is intended to be used by any programmer who wants a messaging app via tor.

 
 # How do I use this library?
 
The only thing to do before you write your code is to add this maven dependency in your pom.xml.

To use it in your Maven build simply add:
```xml
<repositories>
	<repository>
	    <id>jitpack.io</id>
	    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
	</repository>
  </repositories>
```
Then go to dependencies and put the following dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.PanagiotisDrakatos</groupId>
	    <artifactId>T0rlib4j</artifactId>
	    <version>1.0.2</version>
</dependency>
```


:disappointed_relieved: O!! Wait a minute you dont know what is maven? and pom.xml? It doesn't matter, just simple add this <a href="https://github.com/PanagiotisDrakatos/T0rlib4j/releases/tag/1.0.2"> T0rlib4j-v1.0.2-jar-with-dependencies </a> in your project and you will be ready to use the library. By the way, if you have the time and want to learn how you can create a more efficient java project structure just like maven,gradle,etc don't hesitate to navigate here and start gain knowledge <a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html"> How to Setup maven project </a>.

# Java

This code represent the server side part.To be more specific
  * The HiddenServiceDir directive tells Tor where to look for the Hidden Service Directory containing the private key of the Hidden Service. Each Hidden Service Owns it's own directory. The directory needs to be created and having permissions of the Tor User.
 * The Hostname of your new Hidden Service will be available in the file hostname just created in your Hidden Service Directory
 * The tor directive tells in our Serversocket on which port to listen, to forward to which ip and to which port.

<b>Attention!!!</b> we assume that server-client model must be run on different machine because there would be conflict with the tor process. It will be fixed in a new patch update but for now there are other priorities to be done. As we discussed above, the code in this library is pretty trivial.But here is some sample code to get you started.

```java
import net.sf.T0rlib4j.controller.network.JavaTorRelay;
import net.sf.T0rlib4j.controller.network.TorServerSocket;
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import java.io.*;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;
import java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter;
import java.util.Calendar;
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;
import java.net.*;

public class ServerSocketViaTor {
    private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ServerSocketViaTor.class);
    private static final DateTimeFormatter dtf = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("HH:mm:ss");
    private static final int hiddenservicedirport = 80;
    private static final int localport = 2096;
    private static CountDownLatch serverLatch = new CountDownLatch(2);


    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException, ClassNotFoundException, CloneNotSupportedException {
        File dir = new File("torfiles");

        JavaTorRelay node = new JavaTorRelay(dir);
        TorServerSocket torServerSocket = node.createHiddenService(localport, hiddenservicedirport);

        System.out.println("Hidden Service Binds to   " + torServerSocket.getHostname() + " ");
        System.out.println("Tor Service Listen to Port  " + torServerSocket.getServicePort());

        ServerSocket ssocks = torServerSocket.getServerSocket();
        Server server = new Server(ssocks);
        new Thread(server).start();

        serverLatch.await();
    }

    private static class Server implements Runnable {
        private final ServerSocket socket;
        private int count = 0;
        private static final Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
        private LocalDateTime now;

        private Server(ServerSocket socket) {
            this.socket = socket;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {

            System.out.println("Wating for incoming connections...");
            try {
                while (true) {

                    Socket sock = socket.accept();
                    this.now = LocalDateTime.now();
                    System.out.println("Accepted Client "+ (count++) +" at Address - " +  sock.getRemoteSocketAddress()
                            + " on port " + sock.getLocalPort() + " at time " + dtf.format(now));
                    ObjectInputStream in = new ObjectInputStream(sock.getInputStream());
                    System.out.println((String) in.readObject());
                    sock.close();
                }
            } catch (IOException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }

        }
    }
}
```
## How do I connect to Tor?

Once you have Tor running and properly configured you have a few ways of connecting to it. The following is one of the most common method for getting a Controller instance, from the highest to lowest level which library supports.

  * <b>Socket Module:</b> You can skip the conveniences of a high level Controller and work directly with the raw components.  At T0rlib4j lowest level your connection with Tor is a socks4aSocketConnection-socks5aSocketConnection subclass and for the Server socket TorServerSocket subclass. This provides methods to send, receive, disconnect, and reconnect to Tor.
 
T0rlib4j offers two interfaces into the Tor network:
  * <b>SSOCKS 4A:</b> proxy 127.0.0.1:9050
  * <b>SSOCKS  5 :</b>  proxy 127.0.0.1:9050
   
Now for the sake of the completeness we will demonstrate how the Tor client behave. Here is some sample code to get you started.
  
   
```java
import com.msopentech.thali.java.toronionproxy.JavaOnionProxyContext;
import com.msopentech.thali.java.toronionproxy.JavaOnionProxyManager;
import com.msopentech.thali.java.toronionproxy.OnionProxyManager;
import com.msopentech.thali.java.toronionproxy.Utilities;

import java.io.File;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.ObjectOutputStream;
import java.net.Socket;

public class TorClientSocks4 {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException, InterruptedException {
        String fileStorageLocation = "torfiles";
        OnionProxyManager onionProxyManager = new JavaOnionProxyManager(
                new JavaOnionProxyContext(new File(fileStorageLocation)));

        int totalSecondsPerTorStartup = 4 * 60;
        int totalTriesPerTorStartup = 5;
        // Start the Tor Onion Proxy
        if (onionProxyManager.startWithRepeat(totalSecondsPerTorStartup, totalTriesPerTorStartup) == false) {
            return;
        }
        // Start a hidden service listener
        int hiddenServicePort = 80;
        int localPort = onionProxyManager.getIPv4LocalHostSocksPort();
        String OnionAdress = "blablabla.onion";


        Socket clientSocket = Utilities.socks4aSocketConnection(OnionAdress, hiddenServicePort, "127.0.0.1", localPort);

        ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(clientSocket.getOutputStream());
        out.flush();

        out.writeObject("i am workingg");
        out.flush();
    }
}
```

# Acknowledgements
A huge thanks to <a href="https://github.com/thaliproject/Tor_Onion_Proxy_Library"> thaliproject </a> an open source company. This project started by literally copying their code which handled things in Android and then expanding it to deal with Java. A massive admiration on theese people for the great effort

Another huge thanks to the Guardian folks for both writing JTorCtl and doing the voodoo to get the Tor OP running on Android.

And of course an endless amount of gratitude to the heroes of the Tor project for making this all possible in the first place and for their binaries which we are using for all our supported Java platforms.

# FAQ

## What is the maturity of the code in this project?
Well the release version is currently 1.0.1 so that should say something. This is an alpha. We have (literally) one test. Obviously we need a heck of a lot more coverage. But we have run that test and it does actually work which means that the Tor OP is being run and is available.


## Where does jtorctl-briar.jar come from?
This is a fork of jtorctl with some fixes from Briar. So we got it out of Briar's depot. The plan is that jtorctl is supposed to accept Briar's changes and then we will start to build jtorctl ourselves from the Tor depot directly.

## Where did the binaries for the Tor OP come from?
### Android
The ARM binary for Android came from the OrBot distribution available at https://guardianproject.info/releases/. I take the latest PIE release qualify APK, unzip it and go to res/raw and then decompress tor.mp3 and go into bin and copy out the tor executable file and put it into android/src/main/assets

### Windows
I download the Expert Bundle for Windows from https://www.torproject.org/download/download.html.en and took tor.exe, libeay32.dll, libevent-2-0-5.dll, libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll and ssleay32.dll from the Tor directory. I then need to zip them all together into a file called tor.zip and stick them into java/src/main/resources/native/windows/x86.

## Where did the geoip and geoip6 files come from?
I took them from the Data/Tor directory of the Windows Expert Bundle [Why Should i use it](#Why Should i use it)

## Why does the Android code require minSdkVersion 16?!?!?! Why so high?
The issue is the tor executable that I get from Guardian. To run on Lollipop the executable has to be PIE. But PIE support only started with SDK 16. So if I'm going to ship a PIE executable I have to set minSdkVersion to 16. But!!!!! Guardian actually also builds a non-PIE version of the executable.
